## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup and Initial Testing Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ecossio7/backendblass-api-playwright-java.git
cd backendblass-api-playwright-java
```

### 2. Import Project into IntelliJ IDEA

- Open IDE 
- Select **Open** and navigate to the cloned project directory  
- IntelliJ will auto-detect the Maven project and download dependencies  

### 3. Project Structure
```
src/
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/java          # Base code if needed
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/java          # Playwright test scripts
pom.xml                 # Maven configuration and dependencies
README.md               # Project documentation
```

### 4. Run Tests

From the terminal inside the project root, run:

```bash
mvn clean test
```
This command cleans the previous build artifacts and compiles the project. Maven will automatically download any missing dependencies, then it runs all automated tests.

### 5. Customize Configuration
- Modify `pom.xml` to add dependencies or plugins as needed
- Update scripts under `src/test/java` to add or change test cases

---

### üîÄ GitHub Flow Workflow
Always branch off from `main`. Use this branch naming convention:

- `feature/<description>` - For new features
- `issue/<id>-<description>` - For bug fixes or specific tasks
- `hotfix/<description>` - For urgent fixes

Always create a Pull Request for review before merging into `main`.

Keep `main` branch stable and deployable at all times.

## Project Structure

This project follows the standard Maven directory layout, which promotes clear organization and ease of maintenance:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/java # Application source code (if applicable)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/java # Automated test scripts using Playwright
pom.xml # Maven build configuration and dependency management
README.md # Project documentation and instructions
```
